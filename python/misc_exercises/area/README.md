Create a function named `area()` that takes a single argument, a two-member tuple. `area()` should return the result of multiplying the first item in the tuple by the second item in the tuple.

Afterwards, make a variable named `areas` that calculates the area of each item, using your area function. Do this with a list comprehension.
