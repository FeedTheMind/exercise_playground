# Guessing Game

Exercise 9 on [Practice Python](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/04/02/09-guessing-game-one.html) has the following directions:

>Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

>Extras:

>1. Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
>2. Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.


The Good: 

I'm happy with the result, as I handled exceptions and added to the "Extras" section, writing code that 
allows users to choose two whole numbers greater than zero. This small shift
allows for greater flexibility, allowing players to go big or go small. However . . . 


The Needs-Improvement:

. . . after I wrote the code for this guessing game, I realized, "It would have been ideal to incorporate the 'exit'
feature at any point during the game." In other words, if the user chooses lofty numbers, 
he or she will be unable to leave until winning (or killing the program--yuck!).
